## **summary**

cache a computed value between renders, unless it needs to be re-computed.

## **syntax**

```javascript
const cachedValue = useMemo(calculatingFN, [dep1, dep2]);
```

## **calculatingFN**

Usually does heavy computations.

### **input:**

* Takes none.

### **output:**

* returns a value, which we want to cache

### **restrains:**

* cannot take an input
* must return a value
* has to be pure

### **Dependencies**

an array of values, the change of any of which will cause `calculatingFN` to be invoked.

## **use-case**

* when you’re passing a complex value as props
* when you’re doing heavy computation, which doesn’t need to always run.

## **mental model**

I think of useMemo as the cache and the array of dependencies as the cache invalidation.

## **flow**

## fyi

* react determines of a dependency value has changed if its value from the current render is different from its value from the last render. it does this by comparing both values with `object.is`

  Therefore a dependency has to be a simple value.
